## AsyncAPI Workflow Guide

The AsyncAPI workflow guide helps contributors and maintainers understand how shared GitHub Actions workflows are used and managed across repositories within the AsyncAPI ecosystem. It explains the purpose behind each replicated workflow, how to opt into them, and the standards they enforce.

By centralizing and documenting these workflows, we ensure consistency, reduce duplicated effort, and streamline CI/CD practices across all AsyncAPI projects.

The guide empowers contributors to make informed decisions when customizing or adopting workflows, while also supporting maintainers in keeping their repositories aligned with community best practices.
