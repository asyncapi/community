## Internalization and Localization(i18n)

As AsyncAPI gains more users worldwide, it has become crucial to create tutorials, guides, and other forms of documentation that is accessible and adaptable to different cultural contexts. Internalization (often abbreviated as i18n) is the process of designing and preparing content, software, or documentation so that it can be easily adapted for different languages and cultural contexts. Localization (l10n), on the other hand, is the actual process of adapting that content or software for a specific language, region, or culture. This includes translating text, adjusting images, formatting dates and numbers, and making other changes to suit local preferences. This guide provides recommendations and tips to help contributors achieve this goal.

## Key Principles of Internationalization

When designing and AsyncAPI's documentation adaptable to different languages, consider applying the following principles:

1. Language Considerations

* Write content in clear, simple English that can be easily translated
* Avoid idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, and region-specific references
* Use straightforward sentence structures
* Use complex grammatical constructions only when necessary

1. Cultural Sensitivity

* Avoid using cultural references and humor that may not translate or be understood globally
* Be mindful of cultural nuances when writing about specific topics
* Use neutral, professional language that resonates across different cultures

## Localization Best Practices

When adapting AsyncAPI's content to a specific language and its corresponding audience, consider doing the following:

### Translation Preparation

* Use consistent terminology throughout documentation
* Create a centralized glossary of technical terms
* Provide context for translators
* Leave space for translated content to be added later

### Structural Considerations

* Ensure documentation layout supports right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) languages
* Use flexible design that accommodates varying text lengths
* Use dates, units of measurement, and time formats that are consistent across languages

### Technical Implementation

* Use internationalization (i18n) frameworks and tools such as [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)
* Support Unicode and multi-language character sets
* Implement language-switching mechanisms
* Store translatable strings separately from code
