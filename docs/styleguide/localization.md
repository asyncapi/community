## Internationalization and Localization

As AsyncAPI gains more users worldwide, it becomes crucial to create tutorials, guides, and other documentation that are accessible and adaptable to different cultures. Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing and preparing content so it can be easily adapted to multiple languages and locales. Localization (l10n), on the other hand, is the actual process of adapting that content or software for a specific language, region, or culture. This guide provides recommendations and tips to help contributors achieve this goal.

## Key Principles of Internationalization

When designing AsyncAPI's documentation to be adaptable to different languages, apply the following principles:

### Language Considerations

* Write content in clear, simple English that can be easily translated
* Avoid idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, and region-specific references
* Use straightforward sentence structures
* Use complex grammatical constructions only when necessary

### Cultural Sensitivity

* Avoid using cultural references and humor that may not translate or be understood globally
* Be mindful of cultural nuances when writing about specific topics
* Use neutral, professional language that resonates across different cultures

## Localization Best Practices

When adapting AsyncAPI's content to a specific language and its corresponding audience, consider doing the following:

### Translation Preparation

* Use consistent terminology throughout documentation
* Create a centralized glossary of technical terms
* Provide context for translators
* Leave space for translated content to be added later

### Structural Considerations

* Ensure documentation layout supports right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) languages
* Use flexible design that accommodates varying text lengths
* Use dates, units of measurement, and time formats that are consistent across languages

### Technical Implementation

* Use internationalization (i18n) frameworks and tools such as [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)
* Support Unicode and multi-language character sets
* Implement language-switching mechanisms
* Store translatable strings separately from code
