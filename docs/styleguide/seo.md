### SEO Best Practices  

#### Headings

Headings are tags used to make sub titles distinctive from each other. When it comes to making them SEO-friendly, it's highly recommended to do the following:

- **Put them in chronological order:** Since an `h1` tag tend to be titles, always start with this tag. From there, use `h2` and`h3` tags for the subsections and `h4` and `h5` tags for other sections in your tutorial or other piece of documentation.
- **Be descriptive:** Avoid using terms like "Conclusion" and "Introduction" due to their vagueness. Instead, make them specific and ensure they describe the section's content.
- **Include keywords:** Since sites like Google often use keywords to help people's online content appear on the web, Adding these terms effectively is helpful in reaching the tutorials or other pieces of content you create for our project to a wider audience.

#### Alt Text

Alt text are short descriptions of images used to help Google and people who use screen readers gain a better understanding of our tutorials and other pieces of content. To make them SEO-friendly, it's highly recommended to do the following:

- **Describe the image accurately**:  Doing this would help our users understand how to use Asycapi in their work
- **Be concise**: While accuracy is important, avoid writing add every single detail about the image.
- **Use keywords strategically**: Avoid adding every single keyword to your image's alt text. It can overwhelm Google's search engine.

#### URLs

URLs are addresses to webpages and other forms of online content. In the context of SEO, they help make it easier for users to gain access content. To make them more SEO-friendly, use the following methods:

- **Make them short:** It'll make the links easier for users to comprehend and find the needed tutorial on our website
- **Use keywords**: Like alt text, effectively adding keywords in the URL would make it easier for Google to find them.
- **Avoid using special characters and spaces:** Characters like hyphens, numbers, ampersands(&), and spaces can make it difficult for the URL to quickly locate the content you're looking for on our site.
