# AsyncAPI Style Guide: Grammar

## Abbreviations and acronyms

When using abbreviations and acronyms, write the full word with the acronym or abbreviation in parenthesis. After that, use the abbreviation and acronym for them. Here's an example:

"An application can be a micro-service, IoT (Internet of things) device (for example, a sensor), mainframe process, and more.
 That aspect is particularly beneficial in setups like IoT, where topics are often assigned per device or device segment."
 
 By using acronyms and abbreviations effectively, users would easily understand the context and meaning of the abbreviation or acronym and how it relates to the tutorial or guide.

 ## Active Voice 

 When writing documentation and other forms of content for AsyncAPI, use active voice whenever possible. Here's an example:

✅ **DO:** "In the context of channel addresses within AsyncAPI documents, parameters play a crucial role in defining the dynamic components of an address."  
❌ **DON'T:** "In the context of channel addresses within AsyncAPI documents, the dynamic components of an address were defined by parameters."

As shown in the above sentence, active voice makes the concept more engaging and easier to understand.

## Capitalization

When capitalizing titles, headings, and certain words and terms, use the following rules:
- Capitalize the first word of a sentence
- Capitalize the first word in a heading and title
- Capitalize all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions (in, on, at, by, for, with, to, from, of, about, through, between, among, under, over, after, before, during) and some subordinating conjunctions (if, unless, while, until, since, as, because, that, which, who, whom, whose, what, where, when, how, why)
- Avoid using all capital letters for emphasizing a term or concept(use italics sparingly)
- Avoid capitalizing spelled-out acronyms unless they are proper nouns ( API, HTTP, URL), articles(a, an, the), or conjunctions(and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) unless they are part of a title or heading("Parameters in channel address"). 

## Spelling

Asyncapi's content and documentation follows American English spelling standards. Here are some preferred spelling of certain words:
- Use "color" instead of "colour"
- Use "center" instead of "centre".
- Use "organization" instead of "organisation". 
- Use "program" instead of "programme"

## Verb Tense
When writing documentation and other forms of content for AsyncAPI, use the present tense. Here's an example:
✅ **DO:** "The dynamic segment of each channel address, which corresponds to the device identifier, is then articulated through the use of parameters."
❌ **DON'T:** "The dynamic segment of each channel address, which corresponds to the device identifier, was then articulated through the use of parameters."

## Personal Pronouns

 Use personal pronouns sparingly when writing tutorials and other forms of content for AsyncAPI to make them more human and approachable to users.  Here's an example:

 ✅ **DO:** "You can add parameters to the `channel.address` by adding a parameter between curly braces like {`braces`}. Next, use `channel.parameters` to define your parameters. Finally, leverage the `components.parameters` to enable reusable parameters' definitions across multiple channels."
 ❌ **DON'T:** "You can add parameters to the `channel.address` by adding a parameter between curly braces like {`braces`}. Next, use `channel.parameters` to define your parameters. Finally, leverage the `components.parameters` to enable reusable parameters' definitions across multiple channels."
