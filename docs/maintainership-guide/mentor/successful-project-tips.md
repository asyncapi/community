## General Tips

Being a mentor is incredibly rewarding, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your mentorship experience while maintaining balance and boundaries:

### Take a break when needed

- It's perfectly okay to take a break when life gets hectic
- Communicate with fellow mentors or org admins if you're feeling overwhelmed; we're here to support each other.
- Remember: burnout helps no one, not you, not the contributor, and not the project.

### It’s Okay to Fail a Contributor

Sometimes, despite best efforts, a mentorship pairing may not work out. It’s acceptable to mark a contributor as “failed” if:

- They disappear or stop communicating
- They oversold their skills and can’t meet the minimum expectations.
- There are persistent personality issues, such as ignoring feedback, being uncooperative, or refusing to adhere to community standards.

### Set Healthy Boundaries

You are not expected to be available 24/7. Setting clear boundaries helps both you and your mentee thrive. Consider:

- Scheduling weekly or bi-weekly check-ins to track progress and offer guidance.
- Setting up a routine work review to evaluate deliverables.
- Defining your working and non-working hours so expectations are clear from the start.

## Project Idea Tips

The project idea you mentor is the backbone of your AMP experience. A well-scoped, impactful idea not only attracts the right contributor but also ensures a smoother, more rewarding mentorship journey. Here’s what mentors should know and follow when proposing and managing project ideas:

### One Idea, One Contributor

Every AMP project idea is intended for **one dedicated contributor**, with the **exception of documentation-related** projects, which may allow for more than one collaborative effort if clearly scoped. While several applicants may express interest in the same project, **only one proposal will be accepted per idea**. Team-based submissions are not allowed for technical projects; each contributor is solely responsible for their project's execution and success.

### Prioritize Interest & Alignment

Some contributors may be drawn to a popular idea, while others apply without genuine interest or a proper understanding. As a mentor, it’s important to identify applicants who genuinely align with the project. Look for passion, curiosity, and alignment with the project’s purpose.

### Talk Before You Accept

**Never accept a contributor you haven’t spoken to.** A short chat via Slack or a scheduled call can reveal a lot about a candidate’s motivations, communication style, and fit for the project. This early connection also sets the tone for collaboration during the program.

### Request a Contribution

If you find a candidate worthy of acceptance, ask contributors to submit a small, relevant contribution to your project. This serves as a practical skill check, helping you assess their familiarity with the stack, tooling, and codebase, not just what they say in their application.

### Stick to the Plan

Once a project idea is accepted into the program, it **cannot be changed.** Ensure your project scope is clear, realistic, and well-defined from the start. Contributors should tailor their proposals accordingly, and no major pivots are allowed once the program begins.
