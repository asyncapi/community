A successful mentorship program doesn't just happen —like any learning and development program, it depends on intentional planning, mutual trust, and active participation. While the program is designed to support and empower contributors, its success hinges on your commitment and accountability.

To help you get the most out of the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP), we’ve outlined clear expectations. By honoring these, you not only build credibility with your mentor, you also grow faster, collaborate better, and make a lasting mark in the open source community.

### Communication

Clear and consistent communication is non-negotiable. In fact, it's one of the first things mentors look for in a contributor. Here's what we expect:

- **Be responsive:** Check in regularly with your mentor. If you're stuck or unavailable, communicate early.
- **Attend meetings:** Join scheduled sync calls and be punctual. Respect your mentor’s time.
- **Ask questions:** Don’t hesitate to ask for clarity. There are no “dumb” questions—curiosity shows engagement.
- **Give updates:** Share progress weekly or bi-weekly, even if it's minor. This helps mentors guide you effectively.
- **Be professional and respectful:** Treat all community members with empathy, patience, and kindness.

### Collaboration

Open source thrives on teamwork, and your project isn’t a solo mission.

- **Engage with the community:** Participate during the Community Bonding Period. Join discussions on GitHub, Slack, and AMP sync calls to stay in the loop and connected.
- **Work in the open:** Publish your project code in a publicly accessible repository under an [OSI-approved open source license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical), as specified by your mentor or organization.
- **Follow standards:** Adhere to AsyncAPI organization's coding, contribution, and documentation guidelines to maintain quality and consistency.
-  **Be open to feedback:** Embrace constructive input from mentors, peers, and community members to refine your work.
- **Support fellow contributors:** Celebrate each other’s wins, and offer help when possible. Collaboration over competition is the AMP way.

### Commitment

Your project is your top priority during the mentorship phase. You’re expected to dedicate **at least 30 hours per week for 12 weeks** to ensure meaningful progress and learning.

That said, we understand that life happens. Unexpected events like illness, power outages, internet issues, or family emergencies can impact your availability. The key is **transparency and proactive communication.**

If you experience anything that might affect your ability to stay on track, here’s what you should do:

- **Keep your mentor informed:** Notify your mentor as soon as possible if you’ll be unavailable, even for a short period.
- **Set realistic expectations:** If 30 hours/week isn’t feasible, work with your mentor early on to define a manageable and consistent commitment.
- **Manage your time wisely:** Plan around project milestones and meet deadlines to keep your progress steady.
- **Stay accountable:** Follow through on your commitments. Persistence and reliability go a long way in open source.

Remember, your consistency can be the difference between a successful mentorship and a missed opportunity.
