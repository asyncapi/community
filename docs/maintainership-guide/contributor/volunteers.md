Not every contribution needs to be tied to a stipend. The AsyncAPI Maintainership Program(AMP) proudly welcomes volunteer mentees, contributors who are eager to learn, grow, and give back to open source, even without financial compensation. 

## Why Volunteer?

Becoming a volunteer contributor offers you the opportunity to:

- Work closely with experienced maintainers on real-world, impactful projects
- Build a strong technical portfolio through consistent, hands-on contributions
- Grow into a long-term maintainer with the potential to lead future initiatives
- Be a valued member of the AsyncAPI community that fosters learning, inclusion, and collaboration

## What to Expect

As a volunteer mentee, you'll receive the **same support and mentorship** as sponsored contributors, including:

- A dedicated mentor to guide you through your project
- Regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and progress reviews
- Active participation in community discussions and async workflows
- A well-defined project scope that aligns with AMP’s goals

The only difference is that **volunteer mentees do not receive a stipend**. However, the experience, mentorship, recognition, and long-term growth opportunities remain just as impactful.

## Who Can Volunteer?

We encourage volunteer applications from:

- Students, professionals, or newcomers transitioning into open source

- Contributors passionate about AsyncAPI, event-driven architecture, or developer tooling

- Anyone eager to gain mentorship and contribute meaningfully—regardless of financial need

There’s no strict cap on the number of volunteer contributors. As long as your application meets the program’s expectations and there’s a suitable project and mentor available, you’re welcome to join.

## How to Apply

The application process for volunteer mentees is the same as for sponsored contributors.
Just be sure to clearly indicate your preference to participate as a volunteer when submitting your proposal.
