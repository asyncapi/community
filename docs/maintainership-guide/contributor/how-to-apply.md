Applying to the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program (AMP) is simple, but before you get started, we recommend reviewing the [program timeline](../timeline-and-schedule.md) to ensure you’re aware of all key dates and deadlines.

## Eligibility

To qualify for a chance to participate in the Maintainership Program, contributors must meet the following requirements:

- Have made **at least two contributions** to any AsyncAPI project (e.g., code, documentation, community support).
- Must have been an active contributor for at least 4–6 months.
- Be a **student** or a **beginner in open-source** software development.
- **Not currently serving** as a Project Administrator or Mentor in this program cycle.
- Have **only participated once** in the AMP previously.
- Not participating in any **paid open-source** mentorship.

## How to Apply

Before drafting and submitting your application, carefully review the **official list of approved project ideas**. Proposals that are not aligned with listed projects will not be considered.

Here’s what the application process looks like:

- **Explore Projects**: Choose a project from the published ideas list that aligns with your skills and interests.
  
- **Fill Out the Contributor Application Form**: Provide detailed responses that reflect your interest in the program.

- **Showcase Your Experience**: Highlight your previous contributions, technical skills, and what excites you about joining the program.

- **Tailor Your Proposal**: Structure your application around a specific project idea and clearly outline how you plan to approach it.

- **Follow the AMP Proposal Template**: Make sure your application adheres to the official AMP proposal format to maintain consistency and completeness.

- **Await Notification**:
    - Shortlisted contributors will receive an acceptance email and instructions for entering the contribution phase.
    - Those not selected will also receive a follow-up email with feedback or encouragement to stay engaged.

## Not Selected

We truly appreciate the time, energy, and passion you put into applying for a mentorship role in the AMP. While we couldn’t accommodate every applicant in every cohort of the program, **not being selected is not a reflection of your skills or potential**. Our decision was shaped by project needs, availability, and alignment with the specific experiences of the contributors.

That said, **your journey with AsyncAPI doesn’t have to end here**:

- **Stay Involved**: Join discussions, create issues, submit pull requests (PRs), or participate in community calls. The more visible and active you are in the community, the more likely you are to be selected in future cohorts.

- **Contribute to Other Areas**: We’re constantly looking for community champions across documentation, tooling, advocacy, and more. Just raise your hand!

- **Try Again**: Many of our contributors today weren’t selected on their first try. Your continued interest and consistency speak volumes.

If you'd like feedback on your application or want to understand how to better align for the future, feel free to reach out to program organizers. We're here to help you grow, whether you're mentoring or contributing to the community.
