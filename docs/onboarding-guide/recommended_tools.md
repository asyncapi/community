# Contributor - Recommended Tools
This article covers the recommended tools you should have as a contributor. With these tools, you can set up workflows and begin making contributions.

These are the recommended tools:-
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)- to work with the organization's repositories.
- [A GitHub account](https://github.com). AsyncAPI hosts all its project source code and dependencies on GitHub. You'll need a GitHub account to create issues, fork the repository, submit pull requests, and more. If you're new to GitHub, familiarize yourself with [basic GitHub functionalities and workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).
- A code editor, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to work on your changes.
- Command-line terminal, such as the one included in your OS, or the terminal integrated in your code editor or IDE, to run commands.
- [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to build and run the website locally.
- A web browser, such as Google Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge to preview your changes. 
- To preview minor changes in Markdown documents without spinning up a dev server, you can use out-of-the-box capabilities of your code editor, or install the corresponding extension. For more information, please consult your code editor's documentation.
