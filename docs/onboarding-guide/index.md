## AsyncAPI docs onboarding guide

This onboarding guide is for technical writers who are new to the AsyncAPI community to learn how to contribute. For information about contributing to the AsyncAPI codebase, see the [contributing document](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Although intended for a developer audience, writers can find descriptions of general contribution principles and workflows for AsyncAPI projects.

The goal of this onboarding guide is to help technical writers understand the tools, technologies, and processes in our documentation. More specifically, this section will help new writers to:

* Understand consumers of the documentation.
* Identify teammates and subject matter experts (SMEs).
* Find bugs and create issues.
* Make changes to the documentation.
* Receive feedback from reviewers.
* Publish changes.

We encourage you to reach out to the community whenever you have questions. For specifics on communication channels and to move forward with onboarding, start with the [onboarding checklist](/onboarding-guide/docs-onboarding-checklist.md).
