Our prerequisite knowledge section highlights the key technologies, concepts, and skills technical writers should know when working on AsyncAPI documentation. While you don't need to know everything to begin contributing, you should understand the main concepts behind the documentation methodology and tools and the technologies surrounding the AsyncAPI specification.

## Diátaxis framework and content buckets
[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) is a framework that AsyncAPI uses to organize its documentation into content buckets (categories). For an overview of how AsyncAPI's documentation uses diátaxis, see [this post](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/changes-coming-docs).

## Markdown syntax and `mermaid.js` diagrams
AsyncAPI's docs are written in [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Our diagrams are also written with [markdown syntax](https://mermaid.live/) thanks to the [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) dependency.
 
## Familiarity with the open-source ecosystem

Understanding the concepts of open-source software will help you become a strong contributor to this project. For an overview of the AsyncAPI governance model, see [Finding a Good Open Governance Model for AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/governance-motivation). To read AsyncAPI's charter, which gives a high-level organization overview, see [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CHARTER.md).

## AsyncAPI knowledge
Before contributing to the documentation, you should know what AsyncAPI is, its structure, and its purpose. See [here](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/concepts) for an overview of the major AsyncAPI concepts.

You should also have a basic understanding of [the AsyncAPI specification itself](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0). 

## JSON and YAML
Because an AsyncAPI definition can be written in JSON and YAML, understanding how to read, write, and validate these formats is beneficial. See [this post](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/json-schema-beyond-validation) for an overview of the JSON schema used in AsyncAPI.

## Understanding Event-Driven Architecture
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is the style of software design at the core of AsyncAPI's work. Therefore, you should understand the basics of EDA, including its benefits, use cases, and how AsyncAPI conceptually fits into the EDA ecosystem. To get started with EDA, see [here](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started/event-driven-architectures/).

## Protocols used with AsyncAPI
AsyncAPI supports several protocols, including Kafka, AMQP, and MQTT. You should have a [basic understanding of these protocols](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/concepts/protocol#what-is-a-protocol), including their use cases and how they work.
