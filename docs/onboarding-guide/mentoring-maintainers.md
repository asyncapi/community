# Introduction
This guide outlines strategies for mentoring and supporting new maintainers within the AsyncAPI project. By documenting and adopting these strategies, we aim to promote long-term sustainability, reduce the burden on existing maintainers, and ensure new maintainers thrive in their roles.

As we continue to emphasize the importance of onboarding new maintainers, we must also provide them with the necessary tools, guidance, and support to ensure their success. While this document is primarily intended for new maintainers, it also serves as a valuable resource for existing maintainers, contributors, and the broader AsyncAPI community.

## How to do mentoring to get best results
These are some strategies to guide maintainers as they begin their journey.
- **One-on-One Mentorship:** New maintainers are paired with experienced ones for personalized guidance. This allows for direct support, fosters trust, and creates a space for open questions and learning.
- **Shadowing:** Before fully stepping into the role, new maintainers can observe experienced maintainers reviewing code, observing decision-making processes, and attending community meetings. This hands-on exposure helps them build confidence and context.
- **Recorded Breakthroughs:** Experienced maintainers can record video walkthroughs of the project architecture, common workflows, and publishing releases. These videos can serve as a guide for new maintainers and contributors in general.
- **Regular Sync-ups:** Weekly/bi-weekly meetings offer an open forum for discussion, updates, and mentorship. New maintainers are encouraged to attend, ask questions, share challenges, and contribute ideas.

> **Note:** A side effect of having meetings is that it makes mentees reserve their questions for only meeting days. However, async communication is encouraged. New maintainers can ask questions whenever they want.

## Roles and responsibilities of a maintainer
As an AsyncAPI maintainer, your responsibilities include:

1. Guiding the technical direction of the project

2. Reviewing and resolving issues and pull requests

3. Managing CI/CD workflows and GitHub automation

4. Enforcing coding standards and architectural consistency

5. Maintaining and improving documentation

6. Identifying and mentoring new maintainers

7. Supporting contributors and nurturing community involvement

8. Recognizing and celebrating contributions

But being a maintainer is more than just fulfilling tasks; it's about **ownership and leadership**.

You're not just reviewing PRs; you're shaping the future of the project. Whether it's unblocking a stuck contributor, advocating for improvements in the roadmap, or leading releases, maintainers play a crucial role in keeping the project active and healthy.

Maintainers also lead by example by not only solving issues, but also explaining why decisions are made, and guiding others to think critically and collaboratively. It’s about striking a balance between technical excellence and community empathy.

Ultimately, maintainers are the glue that holds everything together, ensuring smooth operations, maintaining community trust, and advancing AsyncAPI’s vision.

## Best Practices for Maintainers
Here are a few principles to guide maintainers in their day-to-day:

- 💬 Communicate openly and clearly. Prefer public discussions to private ones so others can learn too.

- ⚙️ Automate repetitive tasks. Use bots and CI tools to handle routine checks.

- 📝 Document everything. From decisions to ideas,write things down for others to follow.

- 🧑‍🏫 Mentor contributors. Offer feedback, pair programming, or walkthroughs where needed.

- 🙌 Foster participation. Encourage contributors to take ownership and submit improvements.

- ✅ Promote quality. Guide contributors toward thoughtful, well-tested code.

- 📅 Join or host regular meetings. Stay in sync with the rest of the team and community.

- 💚 Take care of yourself. Burnout helps no one. Set boundaries and ask for help when needed.
