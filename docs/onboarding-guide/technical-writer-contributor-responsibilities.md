In the AsyncAPI community, technical writers collaborate with other technical writers, Subject Matter Experts (SME), designers, engineers, and core maintainers. 

Technical writer contributor responsibilities include: 

* Create quality, easy-to-use, clear, and accurate documentation for all audience levels.
* Collaborate with other contributors to propose, create, and maintain documentation.
* Support fellow technical writers and community members.
* Engage in documentation review processes and incorporate feedback.
* Join documentation community meetings/streams to connect with the community.
* Adhere to the [AsyncAPI Style Guide](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+style+guide) to ensure consistency and clarity in our documentation.
