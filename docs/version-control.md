# Version Control

Version control is essential in documentation, just as it is in code. For AsyncAPI, using version control in our documentation process helps us maintain consistency, transparency, and clarity across all content updates.

This section outlines how contributors should manage changes, reviews, and history when working on the AsyncAPI documentation.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Ensure all documentation changes are traceable.
- Help multiple writers collaborate effectively.
- Capture the reasoning behind major updates or changes.
- Keep documentation consistent and up to date.

## 📘 Guidelines

1. **Use Meaningful Commit Messages**  
   - Example: `fix: correct typo in subscription section`  
   - Example: `docs: add example for payload schema versioning`

2. **Always Use Pull Requests**  
   - Never commit directly to the `main` branch.  
   - Every change must go through a PR, no matter how small.

3. **Reference Issues in PRs and Commits**  
   - Link your PRs to issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).  
   - This ensures decisions and changes are well documented.

4. **Small, Focused Changes**  
   - Break large edits into smaller, topic-specific PRs.  
   - Easier to review and maintain.

5. **Request Reviews from the Community**  
   - Always assign reviewers before merging.  
   - Use suggestions and discussions to refine content.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Write changelogs or commit summaries that **explain why** a change was made — not just what was changed.
- Review your diffs before committing to avoid accidental edits.
- Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/docs-version-control`) to isolate your changes.
- Avoid vague commit messages like `Update` or `Fix stuff`.

## 🤝 Contribution Etiquette

- Be respectful and inclusive in code and documentation reviews.
- Use version control as a collaborative tool, not just a technical one.
- Every doc update matters — even the smallest edit improves the ecosystem.
