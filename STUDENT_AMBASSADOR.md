This document covers the organizational and operational aspects of the AsyncAPI Student Ambassador Program.

### What is the AsyncAPI Student Ambassador Program?

After seeing the impact of the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program we thought to extend this to the Student commnunity. This aims to bring AsyncAPI closer to both current users and potential new project users in the student community. It also aims to provide users and community members with the necessary tools and resources to:

- Promote user cooperation and disseminate the necessary tools to any specific user.
- Engage with the project in some way, either as a contributor, blogger, speaker, etc.
- Speak at community events or write technical content (i.e., blog posts) that solves community needs in various institutions. 
- Nurture community growth and a welcoming environment to spread knowledge about the project.

### How does the program work?
The student ambassador selection process will be as transparent as possible. Similar to the existing ambassador program:

- The ambassador selection process will be as transparent as possible.
- The model currently in place for adding members to the Amabassadors through PR will be used.
- The TSC or delegated maintainers of community repositories will evaluate applications according to compliance requirements via a traditional PR flow.
- All student ambassador information will be displayed on the AsyncAPI website in a list after the PR is merged.
- The program has the team tag `@asyncapi/student-ambassadors` to notify ambassadors on GitHub.

### Student Ambassador requirements

Participation will be determined and checked annually. These are the requirement for being a student ambassador:

- Be an active member of the community.
- Be a student or be part of any student alumni club
- Must have merged at least three PR or have written or is to make 3 contributions in the form of articles, talks, videos, podcasts, presentations, driving initiatives, etc.
- Have a good understanding of AsyncAPI tools and specifications.
- Have an interest in mentoring others.
- Enthusiastic about teamwork and collaboration
- Passionate about people, specifically the members and how to support them.
- Accept the AsyncAPI (code of conduct)[https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md]

Ambassadors can be invited to review content (i.e., articles, talks, videos) related to the community. These reviews are optional and will be counted as an additional contribution.

Some clarifications on the type of contributions:
    
- Articles, videos, and podcasts can be published on [asyncapi.com/blog](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog) or other domains. 
- Talks and presentations can be displayed at different events or workshops. Within it, AsyncAPI should appear at the core of the presentation. The presentation would never be used as a disguised marketing tool for other products/projects.
- Special contributions should be driven to support the community or enhance its visibility (i.e., getting new sponsors or driving initiatives) 
- If we did not identify the contributions, just let us know.
         
### Student Ambassador Structure

School Leaders: These are  ambassadors leading all the developers in their schools. They coordinate the regular school activities in regard to the AsyncAPI need


Skill-Based Team Leads: These are ambassadors leading different skill-based teams, such as design team leads, content team leads, etc. The ambassadors in these teams are responsible to their team leads.

AsycAPI Community Manager: Ultimately, ambassadors are directly under the AsyncAPI Ambassadors Program. Issues and concerns should be reported to the Community Manager.

### Become a Student AsyncAPI Ambassador

The process of becoming an student ambassador is very simple. Go to the **community** repository and open a PR to edit the `ambassadors.json` file. The TSC will then evaluate your candidacy!

That PR doesn't have to be created by the student ambassador candidate; any community member may open a PR to submit someone's application to the AsyncAPI Ambassador Program. 

Get on board and become a student ambassador!
