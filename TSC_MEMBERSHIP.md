Definition of common terms in this document:
* **Maintainers:** Are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation, or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository (“Committers”); They are also referred to as CODEOWNERS on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
* **Contributors:** Include anyone in the community that contributes code, documentation, pull request reviews, designs, or other technical artifacts to the Project (“Contributors”);

## What is the Technical Steering Committee?
The TSC is a group of maintainers that contribute to the maintenance of the AsyncAPI Initiative. It is a group of people that helps make decisions that affect not a single project but the entire initiative. The TSC members commit to participate in voting process.

## Why the TSC was formed
The concept of the TSC was formed when AsyncAPI joined the Linux Foundation in 2021 to guarantee a system of open governance that promotes ownership and neutrality of all participants in the initiative.
 
Some of the principles of the Linux Foundation partnership include:

* No founding members with special privileges
* Equality among all contributors
* Asynchronous decision making 
* Every maintainer is allowed to automatically become a TSC member

## Benefits of becoming a TSC member

As a TSC member you will enjoy the following benefits: 
 
* Recognition from AsyncAPI community
* Exposure of your portfolio to potential employers

* Involved in the voting process on topics concerning the entire Initiative
* Included in key decision-making for the Initiative. Especially related to finance. 

## How to become a TSC member
Any maintainer can become a TSC member. In other words, to become a TSC member, you need to become a maintainer of one of the projects in the AsyncAPI Initiative. 
You can become a maintainer by doing at least one of the following items within the AsyncAPI Initiative GitHub organization:
* Initiate a new repository/project and become its maintainer.
* Donate existing repository/project and stay as its maintainer. 
* Support and commit to existing projects and be invited by other maintainers to join them as a maintainer. Learn more in [Become a maintainer in an existing project](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/Become-maintainer-in-existing-project.md)

Joining the TSC is something that you are allowed to do as a maintainer by default, as described in the [charter signed with the Linux Foundation when AsyncAPI joined the foundation](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CHARTER.md). It is not a subject that other TSC members vote on. 

See current [TSC members](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc).
