**Common terms**:
* **Maintainers**: Are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation, or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository (“Committers”); They are also referred to as CODEOWNERS on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)
* **Contributors**: Include anyone in the community that contributes code, documentation, pull request reviews, designs, or other technical artifacts to the Project (“Contributors”);

## What is the Technical Steering Committee?
The TSC is a group of maintainers that contribute to the maintenance of the AsyncAPI Initiative. This group helps make decisions that affect the entire initiative, not only a single project. The TSC members commit to participate in the voting process.

## Why the TSC was formed
The concept of the TSC was formed when AsyncAPI joined the Linux Foundation in 2021 to guarantee a system of open governance that promotes ownership and neutrality of all participants in the initiative.
 
Some of the principles of the Linux Foundation partnership include:
* No founding members with special privileges
* Equality among all contributors
* Asynchronous decision making 
* Every maintainer is allowed to become a TSC member automatically

## Benefits of becoming a TSC member
As a TSC member, you will enjoy the following benefits: 
* Recognition from the AsyncAPI community
* Exposure of your portfolio to potential employers
* Involvement in the voting process on topics concerning the entire Initiative
* Being a part of key decision-making for the Initiative. Especially related to finance.

## How to become a TSC member
Any maintainer can become a TSC member, meaning that to join the TSC, you need to be a maintainer of one of the projects in the AsyncAPI Initiative.

You can become a maintainer by doing at least one of the following items within the AsyncAPI Initiative GitHub organization:
* Initiate a new repository/project and become its maintainer.
* Donate the existing repository/project and stay as its maintainer. 
* Support and commit to existing projects and be invited by other maintainers to join them as a maintainer. Learn more in [Become a maintainer in an existing project](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/Become-maintainer-in-existing-project.md)

Joining the TSC is something that you are allowed to do as a maintainer by default, as described in the [charter signed with the Linux Foundation when AsyncAPI joined the foundation](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CHARTER.md). It is not a subject that other TSC members vote on. 

See current [TSC members](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc).

## How to reach out to the TSC
There are several ways to reach out to the TSC members:
* Join the [AsyncAPI Slack](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite) and ping the `@tsc` group to ask questions or share your thoughts.
* Mention the `@asyncapi/tsc_members` GitHub team in any issue, discussion or pull request. This will also send a message in the `95_bot-tsc-members-mentioned` channel in Slack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the TSC members are volunteers and may not respond immediately.
> Please be patient and respectful. Also it will be helpful if there is as less spam as possible. For more information, please refer to the [Slack Etiquette](./slack-etiquette.md) document.
