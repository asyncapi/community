# AsyncAPI Code of Conduct

## Introduction
Welcome to our community! We are a diverse group of individuals united by our passion for open source and commitment to inclusivity.

Our community promotes and supports inclusivity, welcoming individuals from all backgrounds and experiences. We believe that diversity is our strength, and we actively seek participation from those who enhance it.

Our Code of Conduct governs how we behave publicly or privately when representing the project. It ensures that diverse groups collaborate for mutual advantage and enjoyment and challenges prejudice that could jeopardize anyone's participation in the project.

We expect everyone in our community to treat each other with kindness, empathy, and respect. We believe fostering a welcoming and respectful environment can create a positive and successful community.

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and admins of our community, we pledge to ensure that every individual is treated with respect and dignity. We pledge to create a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment that is free from any form of harassment or discrimination regardless of differences in age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to encourage a diverse, healthy community that celebrates individuality and promotes equality. We will act and interact in ways that promote openness, empathy, understanding, and acceptance of everyone's unique perspectives and experiences.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Publishing content or comments that promote illegal activities.
- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforce Responsibilities

The Code of Conduct Committee (CoC Committee) responds to, investigates, and resolves AsyncAPI Incidents. The Committee is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

The Committee has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. The Committee may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behaviors to the community.
