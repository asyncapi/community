# AsyncAPI Holopin Badges

Welcome to the official AsyncAPI Holopin Badges!

These badges recognize the incredible contributions of individuals and organizations that help drive the AsyncAPI ecosystem forward. From contributors and maintainers to sponsors, mentors, and event volunteers, these badges are designed to be a token of appreciation that you can proudly display.

These badges are created for use on [Holopin](https://www.holopin.io), a platform where contributors can showcase digital collectibles for their open-source efforts.

---

## Design Concept

The AsyncAPI Holopin Badges were created as part of the AsyncAPI 2024 Mentorship Program, designed by [Oloso Surur Olumide](https://github.com/Oloso-surur) under [Aishat Muibudeen's (Maya)](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee) mentorship and with support from [Thulisile Sibanda](https://github.com/thulieblack). This project explores how visual design can be used to celebrate contributions across an open-source ecosystem, turning recognition into something that feels personal, collectible, and proudly displayable.

Inspired by Holopinâ€™s digital badge aesthetic, the designs aim to strike a balance between playful and purposeful. Each badge is crafted to be clear, expressive, and cohesive with the AsyncAPI brand, rewarding contributions while staying visually consistent across a growing and diverse community.

## Color Palette
The colors are drawn from the official AsyncAPI design system, with gradients, dark purples, and clean light tones anchoring the visual direction. The palette was chosen to ensure consistency, accessibility, and flexibility across use cases, from light to dark themes.
