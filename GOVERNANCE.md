## Governance Board (GB) members

You can determine who are the current GB members by filtering the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.yaml) and the [ambassadors](AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.json) with the ìsBoardMember` set to `true`. We also transparently list all the GB members in [AsyncAPI Website](`https://asyncapi.com/community/board`)

To become a GB member, you need to be a member of Technical Steering Committee (TSC). To become a member of TSC, you need to be either Ambassador or Maintainer. 

### Election of the Governance Board

Election takes place every 12-months. First time 3 board members are elected, then after 12-months another 2 members are elected. Then again, since board members are elected for 24-months, we run election to reelect or pick new board members, and so on.

- At least 60 days prior to elections, the Governance Board (GB) must invite the community to suggest candidates. It shoudl be done through a blog post that will be promoted via the current AsyncAPI communication channels.
- People can also submit their application on their own. 
- Information about candidate must be sent to info@asyncapi.io not later than 30 days before elections.
- Nominee must agree to be nominated.
- List of candidates must be published at least on AsyncAPI Website not later than 2 weeks before elections.
- Concerns about candidates should be reported to Code of Conduct Committee. 

GB calls out for voting by presenting the candidates and instructing how people should vote. Voting is private because we need to respect candidates and possible issues related to public rejection. Candidates know their results. Only winners and their votes are presented to public.

TSC members are free to share publicly who they voted on.

#### Explanation of the Board Election and Term Cycle

Board Composition: The board consists of 5 members, each serving a term of 24 months.

Staggered Elections:

- Initial Year (Month 0): At the start, 3 members are elected. These members will serve for 24 months.
- 12 Months Later: After one year, the remaining 2 members are elected. These members will also serve for 24 months.

Continuous Cycle:

- After the initial 24 months, the terms of the first 3 members come to an end. These positions are up for re-election or reappointment.
- One year later (after the 24-month period of the second group ends), the positions of the remaining 2 members are up for re-election or reappointment.

This system ensures a staggered rotation of board members, maintaining continuity in governance while allowing periodic introduction of fresh perspectives.

### Duties and responsibilities

Among others, the duties and responsibilities of the GB are the following:

- Make sure the [charter](./CHARTER.md) is respected.
- Make sure AsyncAPI is a safe and inclusive community for everyone to thrive.
- Make sure AsyncAPI is economically viable, i.e., get more sponsors or other ways of funding.
- Safely hold all the passwords of the services AsyncAPI uses.
- Manage AsyncAPI Initiative employees and hiring process.
- Guarantee everyone who needs it (and has the right to) has access to the services AsyncAPI uses.
- Make sure that regularly sucessions of the GB are done through a transparent voting process.
- Takes care of the funding management, e.g., Open Collective, Github Sponsors, etc.
- Must be a servant leader and has no power other than the specified in the [charter](./CHARTER.md). Everything that is proposed should be voted by the TSC.

Please note that the list above is not an exhaustive list and should not be treated as a legal document but just for reference.


### Governance Board Chairperson

Board members will appoint a chairperson during the first board meeting following an election. The chairperson's term will last 12 months.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC) members

You can determine who is TSC member and has right to vote from [MAINTAINERS.yaml](MAINTAINERS.yaml) and [AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.json](AMBASSADORS_MEMBERS.json), `isTSCMember` properties. We also transparently list all the TSC members in [AsyncAPI Website](`https://asyncapi.com/community/tsc`).

Any maintainer and any ambassador can change their status by editing `isTSCMember` properties.

## Voting

TSC Voting process and all related rules are describe in detail in [voting procedure document](voting.md).

GB election voting is a separate manual process run by current GB members:
- Vote should be sent to info@asyncapi.io not later than two weeks after elections start
- Vote should be a list of candidates that voter want to be GB members. If there are 2 slots available, voter should send 2 names, if 3 then voter should send 3 names. We follow [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) voting process. Candidates with the highest number of votes win.
