### Definition of a Working Group

A Working Group is a group of people in our community who share a common interest beyond GitHub repositories.

A Working Group must have at least one of its members appointed as its chairperson.

Anyone can create a Working Group. The only prerequisites are to have at least 3 founding members and the approval of the TSC (Technical Steering Committee).

A Working Group should have clearly defined goals that are easily accessible to everyone on the internet, as this helps maintain alignment within the group.

It is recommended that the Working Group has an associated project management tool like [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) (or any other project management tool) to outline their roadmap. It's up to the Working Group to decide the structure of the project. E.g., Kanban, Shape Up, TO-DO list, etc.

The group's name, members, goals, and other relevant information must be added to the `WORKING_GROUPS.yaml` file in the `community` repository.

A Working Group has no authority or power over the roadmap of the projects they may impact. It's up to the repositories' maintainers (code owners) to approve or reject the pull requests. Therefore, it's advisable to either have maintainers of the impacted projects in the Working Group or ensure everyone agrees on the roadmap of the different repositories/projects.

Working Groups should be listed on the [AsyncAPI website](https://www.asyncapi.com), along with their description, goals, members, and anything the Working Group wants to include.
