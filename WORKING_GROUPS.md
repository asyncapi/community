### Definition of a Working Group

A Working Group is a group of people in our community who share a common interest beyond GitHub repositories.

A Working Group must have at least one of its members appointed as its **chairperson**.
The selection of the chairperson is done by the members of the group. Volunteers can be chairpersons, or the group can decide to elect one. The chairperson can also resign if they feel they can't fulfill their duties anymore. In this case, the group must elect a new chairperson if there is no other chairperson in the group.
The role of the chairperson is to ensure the group's goals are met, the group works efficiently, and aligned with the AsyncAPI Roadmap. The chairperson is also responsible for running meetings effectively, ensuring that all members have a voice, and that the group works in a transparent manner.
Multiple chairpersons can be elected if the working group members decide it's necessary. The way they share responsibilities is decided by the group.

Anyone can create a Working Group. The only prerequisites are to have at least 3 founding members and the approval of the TSC (Technical Steering Committee).

A Working Group should have clearly defined goals that are easily accessible to everyone on the internet, as this helps maintain alignment within the group.

It is recommended that the Working Group has an associated project management tool like [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) (or any other project management tool) to outline their roadmap. It's up to the Working Group to decide the structure of the project. E.g., Kanban, Shape Up, TO-DO list, etc.

The group's name, members, goals, and other relevant information must be added to the `WORKING_GROUPS.yaml` file in the `community` repository.

A Working Group has no authority or power over the roadmap of the projects they may impact. It's up to the repositories' maintainers (code owners) to approve or reject the pull requests. Therefore, it's advisable to either have maintainers of the impacted projects in the Working Group or ensure everyone agrees on the roadmap of the different repositories/projects.

A Working Group must discuss ideas and solutions in public, and communicate through official channels all relevant discussions and implementations that want to suggest to others.

It is recommended that the Working Group schedules meetings using the methods described at https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/MEETINGS_ORGANIZATION.md.

Working Groups should be listed on the [AsyncAPI website](https://www.asyncapi.com), along with their description, goals, members, and anything the Working Group wants to include.
