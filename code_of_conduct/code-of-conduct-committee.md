# AsyncAPI Code of Conduct Committee

## Purpose

The AsyncAPI Code of Conduct Committee (CoC Committee) is a committee that responds to, investigates, and resolves [AsyncAPI Code of Conduct](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) incidents.

Our [Jurisdiction and Escalation Policy](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct/coc-committee-jurisdiction-policy.md) describes the CoC Committee’s relationship to the Linux Foundation (LF) events staff, who enforce the [Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/), and project-level Code of Conduct responders (e.g., the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee). 

## Members

The CoC Committee consists of 3 [TSC](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) members and 3 members alternates. The members of the interim committee are listed below:

**Community Members** ([elected](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/682#discussioncomment-7498209) by the AsyncAPI community):

- [Azeez Elegbede](https://github.com/acethecreator)
- [Barbaño González](https://github.com/barbanio)
- [Sergio Moya](https://github.com/smoya)

**Alternate Community Members:** 

- [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/mayaleeeee)

- [Alejandra Quetzalli](https://github.com/alequetzalli)

- [Thulisile Sibanda](https://github.com/thulieblack)

If one of the CoC members listed above is unavailable or has to recuse themselves from participating in the resolution of a CoC incident due to a conflict of interest (see our [Conflict of Interest policy](*)), AsyncAPI may  request assistance from the [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) in appointing an alternate from the TSC members to take their place for that incident.

In order to ensure that multiple TSC members are involved in the resolution of each incident,  alternates participate when one or more of the primary TSC members listed above are unavailable (e.g., due to illness) or recuse themselves due to a conflict of interest. Similarly, TSC may appoint an alternate for a particular incident if one of their representatives listed above is unavailable or has a conflict of interest.

## How Decisions Are Made

Decisions of the CoC Committee shall be made by consensus whenever possible.  In the event consensus cannot be reached, decisions shall be made by majority vote of non-conflicted members of the CoC Committee.  A decision to take temporary interim action in the event of an emergency may be taken by any individual CoC Committee member acting in good faith, and the CoC Committee shall review such action and decide whether to confirm or reverse such action.  Any permanent action shall require approval of a majority of non-conflicted members of the CoC Committee.  The CoC Committee may take action without a meeting if a majority of non-conflicted members express agreement in writing (e.g., email or slack) and none of the non-conflicted CoC Committee members either object to the proposed action or request a meeting to discuss the proposed action within 24 hours after the action is first proposed to the CoC Committee. In the absence of such agreement in writing, the CoC Committee may only take action during or after a meeting takes place at which the proposed action is discussed and agreed to by consensus or voted upon by a quorum of the non-conflicted members.  A majority of non-conflicted members shall be deemed a quorum for purposes of a meeting.  See the [Conflict of Interest](*) section of the Incident Resolution Procedures for more information.

## External Support Resources

The CoC Committee may, in its discretion, consult external mediators, investigators, advisors, and consultants as needed to assist with resolution of CoC Incidents. Any such external resources shall not have a vote, and shall be required to maintain confidentiality.
