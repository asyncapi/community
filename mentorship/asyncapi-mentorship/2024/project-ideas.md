### Ideas list

Number | Idea | Area | Lead Mentor | Scope
:---:|---|:---:|:---:|---
1 | [Enhancing Developer Experience in CLI](https://github.com/asyncapi/cli/issues/15) | AsyncAPI CLI | [Aayush Saini](https://github.com/AayushSaini101) | Validate an AsyncAPI file against custom spectral rules & sync my local AsyncAPI file with a remote system (e.g registry). Publish my AsyncAPI file in a schema registry and render AsyncAPI documentation. Fix test cases, we cannot execute test cases directly in the CLI and remaining DX issues in CLI Board.
2 | [AI-Powered AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10505262) | [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) | [Azeez Elegbede](https://github.com/AceTheCreator) | Create an AI-based extension for the AsyncAPI Generator that automatically generates initial AsyncAPI specifications from natural language descriptions or existing API documentation. Leveraging NLP models, this tool can take user-provided requirements and convert them into accurate AsyncAPI specs.
3 | [Becoming a Maintainer of AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10520123) | [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) | [Lukasz Gornicki](https://github.com/derberg) | This initiative aims to guide you on a journey from being a contributor to becoming a maintainer of the project. You'll gain insight into the responsibilities of a maintainer, involving tasks beyond mere coding. Goal is same as [GSoC.](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/issues/1145)
4 | [Performance + Accessibility Improvement of website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/3186) | [AsyncAPI website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website) | [Sambhav Gupta](https://github.com/sambhavgupta0705) |With the addition of multiple components, pages and MD files, it's now important for us to make the website efficient for all web + mobile users. Currently, the performance of the website has critically low numbers in both web and mobile view, which can impact the efficiency and user views in the website. On the other hand, it's also important that we add the necessary accessibility labels to the website. 
5 | [Migration of build + workflow scripts to typescript](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/3187) | [AsyncAPI website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website) | [Ansh Goyal](https://github.com/anshgoyalevil) | With the current package.json built for ES modules and packages, as we migrated the website to Next js 14 + Typescript, it has now started affecting the scripts folder like working of meetings workflow, automation of blog creation using npm script, etc. Since, to have uniformity across the website, we decided to migrate the existing Node js scripts to common js modules (in Typescript), enhancing the code maintenance, scalability, and readability for contributors.
6 | [User Research + Usability Testing on the AsyncAPI Website](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/issues/529) | User Research | [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee) | It would be beneficial if we were to start performing usability tests across our tools periodically to help us gather data that could lead to more grounded ideas for design improvements. Create a new page on the website that can explain the process of being a participant in a user research study and steps to get involved. And because we are open source, this page could also attract an audience of other product designers looking to make open source contributions or to maybe gain experience conducting a user research study. 
7 | [Holopin Design Project](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/issues/1306) | Design | [Aishat Muibudeen](https://github.com/Mayaleeeee)|This project aims to create visually appealing and user-friendly digital badges for our community, ensuring alignment with AsyncAPI's branding and easy recognizability. The goal is to recognize member contributions and creating a vibrant, active community with Holopin’s digital badges.
8 | [Integrating EDAVisualiser Application Focus View into VS Code AsyncAPI Plugin](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10540858) | [AsyncAPI Preview](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview) | [Ivan](https://github.com/ivangsa) |Enhance the VS Code AsyncAPI ([asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview)](https://github.com/asyncapi/vs-asyncapi-preview/issues/235) Plugin by adding [EDAVisualiser's](https://github.com/asyncapi/EDAVisualiser/) application focus view. This new feature will allow users to visualize how an application interacts with other defined applications. The project involves integrating the EDAVisualiser library, implementing a configuration system for related AsyncAPI documents, and creating a user interface to switch between preview modes. Skills required include JavaScript/TypeScript, VS Code extension development, and AsyncAPI knowledge.
9 | [Onboarding Contributor Guides](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10610947) | Docs | [V. Thulisile Sibanda](https://github.com/thulieblack), [Wisdom](https://github.com/wise4rmgod), [Anthony](https://github.com/bandantonio) |The AsyncAPI documentation must include a persona-driven journey for different roles, such as documentation contributors, code contributors, ambassadors, maintainers, etc. The onboarding experience for new contributors isn't as efficient yet, and to solve this problem, we need to develop a series of onboarding guides to automate the onboarding process for new contributors.
10 | [Implementation and integration of new layout for studio](https://github.com/asyncapi/studio/issues/634) | [AsyncAPI Studio](https://github.com/asyncapi/studio) | [Ashish Padhy](https://github.com/Shurtu-gal) & [Fran Méndez](https://github.com/fmvilas) |Studio goes beyond a simple playground to try out the spec and becomes a fully-featured suite to help developers work with event-driven architectures (EDA) and APIs. It will become a tool you can use to easily design your services and share them with your colleagues.
11 | [Path to Maintainership for the AsyncAPI React Project](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10811342) | Coding | [Azeez Elegbede](https://github.com/AceTheCreator) |The [AsyncAPI React component](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi-react) is a handy tool for rendering documentation from your asynchronous APIs, all based on the AsyncAPI specification format. Plus, it helps validate that spec too.
12 | [Expand Community Docs](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10818908) | Docs | [V. Thulisile Sibanda](https://github.com/thulieblack), [Wisdom](https://github.com/wise4rmgod), [Anthony](https://github.com/bandantonio) |Automating the AsyncAPI onboarding experience also involves documenting important workflows and processes for community members involved.
13 | [Technical Blog Posts on Integrating AsyncAPI with Kafka](https://github.com/orgs/asyncapi/discussions/1361#discussioncomment-10885096) | Docs | [Leonardo](https://github.com/leonardotorresaltez) |  Integrating AsyncAPI with Kafka offers a structured approach to managing and documenting Kafka topics, streamlining communication between teams, and enhancing development efficiency. This proposal outlines a series of technical blog posts focused on AsyncAPI’s capabilities, Kafka’s integration potential, and best practices for using these technologies together.
