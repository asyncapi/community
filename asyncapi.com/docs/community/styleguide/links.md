# Links

## Designing Link Structure

When designing link structures in text, assets, and external links, follow these guidelines:

### Text Links
- Use descriptive link text that clearly indicates the destination or purpose of the link.
- Avoid using generic phrases like "click here" or "read more."
- Ensure that the link text is concise and relevant to the content.

### Asset Links
- Use relative paths for linking to assets within the same project.
- Ensure that asset links are up-to-date and point to the correct location.
- Use meaningful file names for assets to improve readability and maintainability.

### External Links
- Use absolute URLs for external links.
- Ensure that external links are valid and point to reputable sources.
- Regularly check and update external links to avoid broken links.
