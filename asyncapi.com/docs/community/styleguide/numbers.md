# Numbers

## When to Use Numbers and Words

- Use numerals for numbers 10 and above (e.g., 10, 11, 12).
- Use words for numbers below 10 (e.g., one, two, three).
- Use numerals for all numbers when they are part of a technical specification, measurement, or when consistency is needed (e.g., 3 cm, 5 MB, 2.5 GHz).

## Using Commas in Numbers

- Use commas to separate groups of three digits in numbers with four or more digits (e.g., 1,000; 20,000; 1,000,000).
- Do not use commas in page numbers, addresses, or years (e.g., page 1234, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, 2021).

## Writing Number Ranges

- Use an en dash (–) to indicate a range of numbers (e.g., 10–20, 100–200).
- Do not use spaces around the en dash.
- For ranges involving time, use the same format (e.g., 9:00–10:00 AM, 2020–2021).
