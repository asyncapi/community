# AsyncAPI Style Guide: Styling

## CSS Code Styling Guidelines

- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming CSS classes.
- Avoid using IDs for styling purposes.
- Use variables for colors, fonts, and other reusable values.
- Keep CSS specificity low to avoid conflicts.
- Use flexbox or grid for layout purposes.
- Ensure CSS is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Font Size Guidelines

- Use relative units (em, rem) instead of absolute units (px) for font sizes.
- Base font size should be 16px (1rem).
- Headings should follow a consistent scale, e.g., h1: 2rem, h2: 1.75rem, h3: 1.5rem, etc.
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability.

## Markdown Styling Guidelines

- Use proper heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.) for document structure.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for lists.
- Use backticks for inline code and triple backticks for code blocks.
- Use blockquotes for quotes or important notes.
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate sections.

## Lists, Images, Diagrams, and Tables Styling Guidelines

### Lists

- Use bullet points for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.
- Indent nested lists properly for clarity.
- Keep list items concise and to the point.

### Images

- Use descriptive alt text for all images.
- Ensure images are responsive and scale properly on different screen sizes.
- Use appropriate file formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, SVG) based on the image type.

### Diagrams

- Use vector-based formats (e.g., SVG) for diagrams whenever possible.
- Ensure diagrams are clear and legible.
- Provide a brief description or caption for each diagram.

### Tables

- Use tables for tabular data only.
- Ensure tables are responsive and scrollable on smaller screens.
- Use proper table headers (th) and data cells (td) for accessibility.
