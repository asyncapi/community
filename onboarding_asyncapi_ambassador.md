# Async API Onboarding Ambassador Guide
Welcome to the AsyncAPI Ambassador Team! 

We are happy you chose to join the ambassador team in making valuable contributions to promote Async API.

Your tenure as an ambassador begins on the date you were accepted. If you were accepted as an ambassador on the 11th of January 2025 by 10th January 2026, your tenure would have expired then we would review your performance so far to determine if you can proceed again as an ambassador.


As an ambassador, you are expected to make a minimum of 4 contributions in a year. This could be either in the form of articles, talks, videos, podcasts, driving initiatives, and so on.

- The articles, videos, and podcasts you make can be published on the Async API blog or other blogs.
- Talks and presentations mainly focused on Async API.
- Contributions to improve the community visibility.
- Booth volunteering.


Example
- If you publish 3 articles and propel 1 initiative about Async API in eight months, then you would become an ambassador for a whole year.
- If you make 1 presentation, write 2 articles, and propel 1 initiative, then you would become an ambassador for a year.
