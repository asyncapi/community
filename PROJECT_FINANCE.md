## Overview 

For the AsyncAPI Initiative, where we seek to enhance the status of Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and associated tooling, your financial support would be greatly appreciated.

The AsyncAPI Initiative is a developing initiative that oversees work on the AsyncAPI specification as well as a variety of tools that support it. It has a large community and a lot of contributions. For a initiative to be sustainable, funding is needed.

The AsyncAPI Initiative reinvests all sponsor funds in the development of the community.

# How can I support this initiative?

Becoming a financial sponsor is the simplest method to support the initiative. There are further financial sponsorship options as well, but they take more effort.

### Contribution of funds 

The following choices are available to contribute money to AsyncAPI:

- **GitHub Sponsors**: Check out our [AsyncAPI GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/asyncapi) 
- **Open Collective**: Visit our [AsyncAPI Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi).
- Visit our [AsyncAPI Linux Foundation Crowdfunding page](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/445898e9-42a2-4965-9e0a-c2a714f381bc).

## Additional forms of financial support

#### Employment

Your employees can be assigned to projects run under the AsyncAPI Initiative and routinely contribute. New maintainers are welcomed with open arms.

Additionally, you can provide a member of the [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) your direct assistance. For particular work on the project, you can provide a contract or employment.

#### Events organization

We host various AsyncAPI conferences each year. As long as you can sponsor it and help arrange it, you can assist us in running events with the AsyncAPI logo in any venue you provide.

#### Services

The AsyncAPI Initiative maintains a wide variety of tools. There are numerous expenses to pay for in order to obtain various platform services, which we are currently unable to do. Your business may provide services like hosting or storage.

## How do we manage expenses?

The money from GitHub Sponsors is transferred straight to our AsyncAPI Open Collective.

We handle expenses on two platforms because Open Collective and Linux Foundation Crowdfunding are separate.

Transparency is practiced in all expenditures. Technical Steering Committee is consulted before every new anticipated expense.

## Spendings

The AsyncAPI Initiative is a community-driven project that needs a range of financial expenses:

### Mentorship

Through a specific AsyncAPI Mentorship program, we offer paid mentoring to community members who lack expertise so they can add valuable features to AsyncAPI projects. By investing in new tools and newly recruited, highly driven community members who bring a fresh perspective to the project, we can ensure that donations are returned to the community.

### Hiring

Our huge and expanding community necessitates a full-time dedication. We are able to sign contracts with people to work on the AsyncAPI Initiative thanks to the assistance of Open Collective. This year, [Thulie] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-thulisile-sibanda/) was hired as the initiative's community manager. In the long run, we would like to expand our staff.

### Swags Store

To effectively share swag with contributors, mentees, ambassadors, and other community members, we require our very own swag store. We can sell part of the stuff through the swag store and put potential earnings toward paying for the swags we give for free.

### Bounty

We want to make sure that the community of contributors and maintainers is not solely comprised of company-sponsored employees or volunteers. Making sure we don't take advantage of volunteer labor is important.

Newcomers to technology and open source are not compensated for their work. In return, we provide them with free mentoring and help them develop contributor portfolios that make it simpler for them to land their first or better tech job. 

The bounty program's objective is to reward and acknowledge consistent, seasoned contributors and maintainers.

### Services

Since some of the services necessary for running the AsyncAPI Initiative are not accessible through specific open-source support programs, we periodically have to pay for tools like Zoom or Descript.

### Events

We host AsyncAPI conferences, which entail spending money on various conference-related services or travel costs.
