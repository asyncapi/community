# Support AsyncAPI Initiative

Your support would be greatly appreciated for AsyncAPI, where we aim to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and their tooling.

In order to support AsyncAPI, the following options are available -

- **Open Collective**: Visit our [Open Collective Page](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi)
- **GitHub Sponsors**: Visit our [GitHub Sponsors Page](https://github.com/sponsors/asyncapi)
- **Linux Foundation Crowdfunding**: Visit our [Linux Foundation Crowdfunding Page](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/445898e9-42a2-4965-9e0a-c2a714f381bc)


# How do we manage expenses?

1. AsyncAPI Initiative welcomes support in all 3 ways mentioned above.

2. In case of GitHub Sponsors, the fund is directly transferred to Open Collective.

3. Since Open Collective and Linux foundation Crowdfunding are totally disjoint, 
   thus we can conclude that we can conclude that we manage expensed in 2 platforms ->
   
   - Open Collective & GitHub Sponsors fundings on Open Collective
  
   - Linux Foundation Crowdfunding on the same
