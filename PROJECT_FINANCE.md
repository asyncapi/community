## Support AsyncAPI Initiative

Your financial support would be greatly appreciated for the AsyncAPI Initiative, where we aim to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and their tooling.

In order to support AsyncAPI, the following options are available:

- **Open Collective**: Visit our [AsyncAPI Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi)
- **GitHub Sponsors**: Visit our [AsyncAPI GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/asyncapi)
- **Linux Foundation Crowdfunding**: Visit our [AsyncAPI Linux Foundation Crowdfunding page](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/445898e9-42a2-4965-9e0a-c2a714f381bc)


## How do we manage expenses?

1. AsyncAPI Initiative welcomes support in all 3 ways mentioned above.

2. In the case of GitHub Sponsors, the fund is directly transferred to our AsyncAPI Open Collective.

3. Since Open Collective and Linux foundation Crowdfunding are disjointed, we manage expenses in 2 platforms:
   
   - Open Collective & GitHub Sponsors fundings transfers to Open Collective
  
   - Linux Foundation Crowdfunding
