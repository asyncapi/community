## Overview

Your financial support would be greatly appreciated for the AsyncAPI Initiative, where we aim to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and their tooling.

AsyncAPI Initiative is a growing project that oversights work not only on AsyncAPI specification but also a number of different tools supporting it. It has a large community with many contributors. Project sustainability requires financial support.

AsyncAPI Initiative invests all the sponsor money back into community growth.

## How to sponsor the initiative?

The easiest way to sponsor the initiative is to become a financial sponsor. There are also other ways to sponsor with money, but they require more work.

### Financial sponsorship 

In order to financially support AsyncAPI, the following options are available:

- **Open Collective**: Visit our [AsyncAPI Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/asyncapi)
- **GitHub Sponsors**: Visit our [AsyncAPI GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/asyncapi)
- **Linux Foundation Crowdfunding**: Visit our [AsyncAPI Linux Foundation Crowdfunding page](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/445898e9-42a2-4965-9e0a-c2a714f381bc)

### Other ways of financial sponsorship

#### Employment

You can delegate employees to regularly contribute to projects hosted under AsyncAPI Initiative. We are always happy to onboard new maintainers.

You can also directly support one of the members of the [Technical Steering Committee](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc) that are available for hire. You can offer employment or a contract for specific work on the project.

#### Events organization

Every year we organize different AsyncAPI Conferences. You can help us to run AsyncAPI-branded events in any location you offer as long as you can sponsor it and help organize it.

#### Services

AsyncAPI Initiative maintains a lot of different tools. There are a lot of costs to cover to get different platform services that we are unable to cover at the moment. Your company can offer services like hosting platforms and storege.

## How do we manage expenses?

1. AsyncAPI Initiative welcomes support in all 3 ways mentioned above.

2. In the case of GitHub Sponsors, the fund is directly transferred to our AsyncAPI Open Collective.

3. Since Open Collective and Linux foundation Crowdfunding are disjointed, we manage expenses in 2 platforms:
   
   - Open Collective & GitHub Sponsors fundings transfers to Open Collective
  
   - Linux Foundation Crowdfunding 

All spendings are done transparently. Every new planned expense is consulted with Technical Steering Committee.

## Our expenses

AsyncAPI Initiative is a community-first project that requires a variety of different investments:

### Mentorship

We run a dedicated AsyncAPI Mentorship program to enable inexperienced community members to implement meaningful features in AsyncAPI projects through paid mentorship. This way we assure that donated money goes back to the community through investment in new tools and new highly motivated community members that bring a fresh look into the project.

### Hiring

We are a large and growing community that requires a full-time commitment. With the support of Open Collective, we are able to sign contracts with people to work on AsyncAPI Initiative. This year we hired [Thulie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/v-thulisile-sibanda/) as Community Manager for AsyncAPI Initiative. Long term we would like to hire more people.

### Swags Store

We need our own swag store that enables us to efficiently â€‹distribute swags with contributors, mentees, ambassadors and other community members. Swag store enables us to also sell some of the swags and invest potential revenue to cover costs of swags that we give away.

### Bounty

We want to assure the community of contributors is not based only on company-sponsored or volunteer-based work. We want to make sure we do not exploit voluntary work.

People that are new in tech and open source are not paid for their work. In exchange, we offer them free mentorship and enable them to build contributor portfolio that makes it easier to get a first or better job in tech. 

The bounty program goal is to recognize and gratify regular and experienced contributors and maintainers.

### Services

Some of the services necessary for running the AsyncAPI Initiative are not available through dedicated open-source support programs, so we sometimes have to pay for tools like Zoom or Descript.

### Events

We organize AsyncAPI conferences that require investment in different conference-related services or travel expenses.
